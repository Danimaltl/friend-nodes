Goal: Take the data set, and figure out how close they are to you

User Stories:

As the front end developer: I want some number \in [0,1] to represent "closeness"
As an analyist: I want this to reasonably model "closeness" in a
                reasonably simple way.


Solutions:

Model closeness based on "interactions" i.e. I sent/received x text
                                             I sent/received x fb posts

How do I figure out relative closeness?

Analyst Solution:

   Get the average interactions/day for the entire data set.
   Figure out the standard deviation.
   Find out how many SDs the average of each person's interactions/day
      deviates from the overall average. This number of Standard Deviations
      from the average represents that person's "closeness" to the user.

Front End Developer Solution:

   Normalising the "closeness" of each person into a [0,1] scale.
   
   Choose some length r (probably just under the length of the screen)
   
   If anything has a SD score > 4, set that to 4.
   If anything has a SD score < -4, set that to -4.

   Add 4 to every score, and divide each score by 8.

   This turns each closeness score into a number between 0 and 1.

   f: N -> [0,1] 

   To scale this for display on the graph, I take my length r and score c:

   distanceFromCenter = (1 - c) * r;
