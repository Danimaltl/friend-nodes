# meteorcytoscape_minimal
as it took me some time to make meteor working with cytoscape.js, here is minimal config

data are part of hello.js. Yes, i know it can be even shorter, but it is still basic..

so 
1.
meteor create projectcyto
2.
cd projectcyto
3.
meteor add maxkfranz:cytoscape

4.
then add hello.js hello.css hello.html to folder

5.
and then run
meteor...  drag and move node...
